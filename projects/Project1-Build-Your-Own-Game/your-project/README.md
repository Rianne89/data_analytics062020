## Project Description
This project contains the code for the Minesweeper game. The code needs to be executed in processing.py, see link below.

## Rules
The goal of this game is to uncover the places of all the mines in the game by flagging them, and not clicking on them.
The numbers on the tiles reveal the number of mines adjacent to it, this helps the player to uncover where all the mines are located.

With a *right* mouse click the player uncovers a tile
With a *left* mouse click the player can flag a tile

## Workflow
1st: Defined visualization tool
     Defined process using flowchart
     Defined global values
     Defined Tile classes
2nd: Listed all needed functions
     Built all needed functions
3rd: Linked all codes together
4th: Added graphics: colors, flags etc.
    

## Organization
The planning for this project was done using a paper kanban board. Pictures will be added later.

The repository contains one file with the code "minesweeper_game" and a README.md file that contains this document.
